# Trying to use CROPS Poky Yocto container

The initial assumption was that pull the CROPS Poky container would offer directly the Poky Yocto toolchain. In practice, you still need to clone it to the work directory. In practice, the CROPS container provides most of the dependencies required for running Poky Yocto.
In the next attempt, I will try to create a container that looks a bit more what I expected CROPS to be.
